---This text file is for recording the observations from steps 3 + 4, and stept 5.
3) Got an error saying Worker Failed to exit in 2000 miliseconds.
4) Threads were displaying and when I hit the stop button there were no errors on the Form.
5) Why does the debugger wait for a few seconds? The debugger waits for seconds since the override void Onclosed was removed and there is no Join on the form that sends the 2000 mS Join the worker.
5) Why does making the thread a background thread allow the application to exit quicker?  Background threads are identical to foreground threads, except that background threads do not prevent a process from terminating. Once all foreground threads belonging to a process have terminated, the common language runtime ends the process. Any remaining background threads are stopped and do not complete.
